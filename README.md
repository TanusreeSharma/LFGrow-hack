########## Use Case ##########
For example, A student from X university wrote a paper, submitted to a conference. when get accepted, she got a copyright agreement to manage access. If she wish to retain all rights to her work, then she needs to choose author-pays option, which almost 700-900$. Most authors go with no pay option with non-inclusive permission to publisher. Then, Her university library purchase the access to include paper in library database. And she then access the paper through her university database. Very long winding process
